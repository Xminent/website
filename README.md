# Website

A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application which I use for my personal website, [xminent.com](https://xminent.com). This was not created for the purpose of being a template, as the code is not easily customizable. However, you are free to use it as a reference for your own projects.

## Features

- Support for multiple subdomains using Next.js *middleware*
- Authentication using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org/)
- Good styling using [NextUI](https://nextui.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Markdown HTML rendering for use in blog applications
- An API that allows registered users to search for waifus, with information courtesy from [mywaifulist.moe](https://mywaifulist.moe/)
- PWA Support using [next-with-workbox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-with-workbox)
